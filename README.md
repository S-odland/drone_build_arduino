### Drone Flight Control Software

This repository houses the arduino code; flight controller, websockets host, wifi setup and the website code; html, javascript css to make a functional website

The arduino code includes custom libraries for i2c communication between the ESP32 and LSM6DS33 6-axis IMU which can be found in my [drone_build_library repository](https://github.com/S-odland/drone_build_library)
